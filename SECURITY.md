## Reporting a Vulnerability


<!-- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability. -->
The Rswag team currently does not have a mailbox for security vulnerabilities. Please report discovered issues in the GitHub issues section, tagging public members.

<!-- Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. -->
We will get back to the issue as soon as possible.
